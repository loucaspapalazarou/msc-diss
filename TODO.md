Code
----------
- Visualize sensors
- Train with less targets (more accuracy?)
- Request cirrus hours?

- Task is very specific, could be used for robots that do specific tasks, ideally trained with thousands of tasks
- Add figures of signals from sensors 7,8,9 (or whtever target is) and then figures from predicted signals using all my models
- Say that there are a lot of approaches (seq2seq etc) justify why we went with our specific ones
- (Future work) Principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm, add that inthe future work, curse of dimensionality
- Problem formalization in more detail, use letter notations and stuff like that
- Add that inference is slow, say it in drawbacks etc
- Image processing each step, slow
- Unfortunately, due to the time contraints a lot of the descisions had to be made ad-hoc, empiricaally and using our best judgment without being able to fully each one
- Retrospection section, heinsight is 20-20
- Appendix with all figures and configs
- List of figures
