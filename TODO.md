- predict.py
- INFERENCE IN TRANSFORMER (use only decoder/encoder?)
- Add that inference is slow, say it in drawbacks etc
- predict for mamba
- visualize snsors
- get more targeted and say that you tried predictig many sensors together in the report but decreased accuracy

diss caveats:

task is very specific, could be used for robots that do specific tasks
ideally train with thousands of tasks

Figures of signals from sensors 7,8,9 (or whtever target is) and then figures from predicted signals using all my models

Say that there are a lot of approaches (seq2seq etc) justify why we went with our specific ones

corssentropy loss?

- Principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm, add that inthe future work, curse of dimensionality

- problem formalization in more detail, use letter notations and stuff like that

- add baseline model? classifier?
