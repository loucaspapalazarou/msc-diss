Code
----------
- !!!!!! FIX TRAINING !!!!!!
- Train RNN (baseline)
- Visualize sensors
- Train with less targets (more accuracy?)

----------

- Task is very specific, could be used for robots that do specific tasks, ideally trained with thousands of tasks
- Add figures of signals from sensors 7,8,9 (or whtever target is) and then figures from predicted signals using all my models
- Say that there are a lot of approaches (seq2seq etc) justify why we went with our specific ones
- (Future work) Principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm, add that inthe future work, curse of dimensionality
- Problem formalization in more detail, use letter notations and stuff like that
- Add that inference is slow, say it in drawbacks etc
